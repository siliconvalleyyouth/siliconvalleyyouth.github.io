                              <p>The Science Bowl class is well prepared by Oliver and Tim. There are a lot of interactions during the classes. Kids are motivated to participate and ask questions. It is a very good class for kids to learn the science bowl competition and related science knowledge. My son Wayne always looks forward to it even after long swimming meets during the day. As parents, we appreciate Oliver and Tim's efforts and time. Also thanks to Oliver and Tim's Moms!

                              <p>Henry loves the science bowl class. He got greatly inspired by the two teachers and always wanted to go to the classes even after exhausted physical training right before the Science Bowl sessions. We as parents are impressed by the knowledge of the teachers and their genuine passion in teaching the students to explore and excel .Thank you so much Oliver and Tim! Great job!</p>

                              <p>The first Science Bowl experience with Oliver and Tim for my son Minh was great! Both teachers are not only knowledgeable but also have great desire to share it with their students. They were able to bring the class back to focus before some young students getting too excited. Best of all, this class makes Science a "COOL" subject. Thank you, Oliver & Tim! Also appreciated all the parents' great effort! </p>

It is a very good class for kids to learn the java language and related coding knowledge. I always look forward to it even after long staying at home during the day! </p>

                              <p>My daughter enjoys her history classes so much, and sheâ€™s looking forward to her class every week. The topics they discussed are very interesting to her. She also likes her teachers Justin and Cayden. They are very humorous and knowledgeable, which makes the classes so much fun. One thing to add from parent, they are very responsible for their teaching, the slides they made are so well, and the presentation is so good (I listened to one recording one time, and I enjoyed their classes too). There are a few times we have to miss classes due to conflicts, they also offered to spend extra time after class to help my daughter make it up. Really appreciate it!! </p>
