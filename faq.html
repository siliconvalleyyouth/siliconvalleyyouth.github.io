                <i style="font-size:18px">Why is my class being recorded?</i>
    
                <p>At SVY we record classes to ensure quality. These recordings will not be accessible to the public, 
                and will only be used for internal teacher training and review purposes by the SVY team only.</p>
                
                <i style="font-size:18px">Can I get a link to a class recording?</i>
                
                <p>No. SVY does not allow any class recordings to be played for students or any other public party. 
                If you wish to make up material that you might have not attended, contact your teacher and they will 
                provide you with the information you might have missed, or meet with you outside of class.</p>

                <i style="font-size:18px">How do refunds work?</i>
    
                <p>SVY has a 1 class refund policy. After taking the first class, if you are unable to or do not want 
                to attend the second lesson, we will provide you with a full refund. In order to qualify for a class refund, 
                you must email us at svyfinance@gmail.com a minimum of 24 hours before the second class starts.</p>
                
                <i style="font-size:18px">When can I expect my refund?</i>
                
                <p>We will send a confirmation for your refund within 48 hours of your request. Due to the processing system 
                that we use, most refunds take between 5-7 business days to complete.</p>
                
                <i style="font-size:18px">Who do I contact to refund classes?</i>
