                        results during the COVID-19 period and through fierce competition among many educational institutions. 
                        With its eminent reputation, quality of education, and the efforts of an enthusiastic team of parents 
                        and teachers, SVY has grossed a large amount of enrollment reaching over three hundred enrollees. 
                        This is a year over year growth of 23%. We are so proud of every single teacher, parent, student, 
                        and volunteer that has contributed to this exuberant growth. Go SVY!</p>

                    <p>As the new semester starts, freshmen and sophomores in high school are faced with many questions. There 
                        are so many clubs, which ones are suitable for me? So many competitions, how can I get involved? High 
                        school is super busy, how can I efficiently manage my time? Also, for middle schoolers who are curious 
                        about high school life and classes, they are also preparing for the upcoming year.</p>
                    <p>SVY hosted a High School Advice panel event where several experienced high school juniors and seniors 
                        discussed topics including high school study habits, clubs and extracurriculars, time management, and 
                        much more and also answered various questions in an open Q&A!</p>

                    <h3>Santa Clara Valley Medical Center's Mask Donation Ceremony</h3>
                    <p>We have been continuing our efforts in helping the community stay safe. As mentioned 
                        before, we have made donations of bought surgical masks as well as homemade ones to 
                        different people. But recently, the executive team attended the Santa Clara Valley 
                        Medical Center's mask donation celebration where in total, we donated 5,000 surgical 
                        masks and 200 homemade, reusable ones to them. Together with the contributions and 
                        donations of the Shin Shin Educational Foundation, our donations amounted to over a 
                        whopping 25,000 personal protective equipment. As a community, our combined efforts 
                        are sure to put an end to this battle against COVID-19.

                    <h3>Silicon Valley Youth Actions Against COVID-19</h3>
                    <p>
                        The current COVID-19 pandemic marks a time that will go down in history as an unprecedented threat affecting people globally. As the urgency rises, people all around the world are banding together to be able to fight off and overcome the virus. A leader in the Bay Area, SVY is leading and coordinating this effort within the community by supporting others, donating supplies, and holding a fundraiser.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        SVY is making a donation of over 8,000 effective face masks for the seniors in our community because COVID-19 is exponentially more threatening for the elderly and those who are immunocompromised. Thus, it is our mission to be able to provide for those in most immediate danger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On top of this, SVY has continued to promote education through free online courses offered to students all around the community. The classes include, Current Events, Discrete Math, AMC8 Math, Book Club, USACO, Economics, and Coronavirus and Immunity class. It has been incredible for us to be able to interact and bond with the people around us even while sheltering in place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, outside of the quarantine, SVY has donated $10,000 to the Ravenswood School District towards iPads. This will allow the students to be able to obtain more opportunities through technology for learning and education. We are helping those who are less fortunate in our community to be able to lead a life full of success by providing them with various tools and opportunities.

                 Despite the recommendation from CDC of wearing mask in public, the seniors have difficulty sourcing masks in stores.
              </p>
              <p>The Bay Area Community Mask Project is initialized by Silicon Valley Youth to help our community fight against the
                 COVID-19 pandemic. We are making reusable masks for those who are in need the most. Our goal is to make 1,200 masks by
                 mid-May.

                    <h3>Silicon Valley Youth Leadership Panel</h3>
                    <p>SVY sponsored a leadership conference ($5500) for middle school and elementary school leaders in
                        collaboration with FMSD, and also sent 8 teachers: Oliver, Leo, Anouk, Arthur, Max, Ansh, Cindy,
                        and Sean. In the morning the teachers gave around 160 students from 22 schools various workshops
                        for leadership; in the afternoon, they met with students to help draft a timeline of events and
                        activities the leadership team would plan. The students then pitched their ideas to their
                        principals and discussed the details.</p>

                        Bryan Owens and Benjamin Owens each taught
                        English to a class of 30 high school students
                        in Haimen, China. It is a free class which
                        lasted three weeks, every day. Bryan taught
                        critical reading. Benjamin taught
                        grammar. Students in Haimen never had a chance
                        to listen to authentic spoken English, rarely
                        had the opportunity to speak English
                        either. So this is a very high quality and
                        special class for them.

                    <p>Bryan and Ben recruited two volunteer string teachers to teach at Ravenswood middle schools, allowing
                        RCSD to finally open up a strings program.</p>
                    <p>Historically, students who attended Menlo-Atherton High School from East Palo Alto and East Menlo
                        Park
                        were never able to join their high school orchestra because they did not have sufficient experience in
                        string instruments. Ravenswood School District had aquired the violins necessary for an after school
                        music
                        program, but they did not have the funds to support a string teacher.</p>
                      <p>After a long search by Benjamin for organizations willing to help, on July 22, Sono Strings said they
                        might be able to provide teachers.</p>
                      <p>Immediately after Dr. Hernandez-Goff came back to work, Bryan and Benjamin met her and Ms. Lorena
                        Morales-Ellis again at the district office. Benjamin then set up a meeting between Ravenswood School
                        District and Sono Strings for the very next day. The meeting was successful. Not only did Sono Strings
                        agree to provide two volunteers, but they also agreed to maintain the string instruments for free,
                        hold
                        benefactor concerts, train the students to put on a holiday concert, and provide extra support.
                        Ravenswood
                        City School District will now be able to offer a string class to its students.</p>
