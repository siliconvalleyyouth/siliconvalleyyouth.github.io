                    <h3>Santa Clara Valley Medical Center's Mask Donation Ceremony</h3>
                    <p>We have been continuing our efforts in helping the community stay safe. As mentioned 
                        before, we have made donations of bought surgical masks as well as homemade ones to 
                        different people. But recently, the executive team attended the Santa Clara Valley 
                        Medical Center's mask donation celebration where in total, we donated 5,000 surgical 
                        masks and 200 homemade, reusable ones to them. Together with the contributions and 
                        donations of the Shin Shin Educational Foundation, our donations amounted to over a 
                        whopping 25,000 personal protective equipment. As a community, our combined efforts 
                        are sure to put an end to this battle against COVID-19.

                    <h3>Silicon Valley Youth Actions Against COVID-19</h3>
                    <p>
                        The current COVID-19 pandemic marks a time that will go down in history as an unprecedented threat affecting people globally. As the urgency rises, people all around the world are banding together to be able to fight off and overcome the virus. A leader in the Bay Area, SVY is leading and coordinating this effort within the community by supporting others, donating supplies, and holding a fundraiser.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        SVY is making a donation of over 8,000 effective face masks for the seniors in our community because COVID-19 is exponentially more threatening for the elderly and those who are immunocompromised. Thus, it is our mission to be able to provide for those in most immediate danger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On top of this, SVY has continued to promote education through free online courses offered to students all around the community. The classes include, Current Events, Discrete Math, AMC8 Math, Book Club, USACO, Economics, and Coronavirus and Immunity class. It has been incredible for us to be able to interact and bond with the people around us even while sheltering in place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, outside of the quarantine, SVY has donated $10,000 to the Ravenswood School District towards iPads. This will allow the students to be able to obtain more opportunities through technology for learning and education. We are helping those who are less fortunate in our community to be able to lead a life full of success by providing them with various tools and opportunities.

                 Despite the recommendation from CDC of wearing mask in public, the seniors have difficulty sourcing masks in stores.
              </p>
              <p>The Bay Area Community Mask Project is initialized by Silicon Valley Youth to help our community fight against the
                 COVID-19 pandemic. We are making reusable masks for those who are in need the most. Our goal is to make 1,200 masks by
                 mid-May.

                    <p>SVY sponsored a leadership conference ($5500) for middle school and elementary school leaders in
                        collaboration with FMSD, and also sent 8 teachers: Oliver, Leo, Anouk, Arthur, Max, Ansh, Cindy,
                        and Sean. In the morning the teachers gave around 160 students from 22 schools various workshops
                        for leadership; in the afternoon, they met with students to help draft a timeline of events and
                        activities the leadership team would plan. The students then pitched their ideas to their
                        principals and discussed the details.</p>
