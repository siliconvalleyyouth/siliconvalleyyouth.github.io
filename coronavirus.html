            <h3>Silicon Valley Youth Actions Against COVID-19</h3>
            <p>
                The current COVID-19 pandemic marks a time that will go down in history as an unprecedented threat 
                affecting people globally. As the urgency rises, people all around the world are banding together to 
                be able to fight off and overcome the virus. A leader in the Bay Area, SVY is leading and coordinating 
                this effort within the community by supporting others, donating supplies, and holding a fundraiser.
            </p>
            <p>
                SVY is making a donation of over 8,000 effective face masks for the seniors in our community because 
                COVID-19 is exponentially more threatening for the elderly and those who are immunocompromised. Thus, 
                it is our mission to be able to provide for those in most immediate danger.
            </p>
            <p>
                On top of this, SVY has continued to promote education through free online courses offered to students
                 all around the community. The classes include, Current Events, Discrete Math, AMC8 Math, Book Club, 
                 USACO, Economics, and Coronavirus and Immunity class. It has been incredible for us to be able to 
                 interact and bond with the people around us even while sheltering in place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, outside of the quarantine, SVY has donated $10,000 to the Ravenswood School District towards 
                iPads. This will allow the students to be able to obtain more opportunities through technology for 
                learning and education. We are helping those who are less fortunate in our community to be able to lead
                 a life full of success by providing them with various tools and opportunities.

          <p;>Shortages in masks and other personal protective equipment take an extra toll on elders amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
             Despite the recommendation from CDC of wearing mask in public, the seniors have difficulty sourcing masks in stores.
          </p>
          <p>The Bay Area Community Mask Project is initialized by Silicon Valley Youth to help our community fight against the
             COVID-19 pandemic. We are making reusable masks for those who are in need the most. Our goal is to make 1,200 masks by
             mid-May.

            <p>SVY has been teaching various online courses to students, in order to 
              continue to promote learning and education even when away from school. Currently, we host eight classes ranging
               from Economics to Current Events, and it has been an honor being able to teach students and bond with them even
                when we are social distancing. These online courses have allowed us to stay connected and be able to continue
                 helping students learn new things each day!
